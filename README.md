So I am editing this from here. I had an issue with Atom on my computer and couldn't reach help in time. 

SO WHAT I LEARNED IN THIS PROJECT
How to create While loops to execute functions using arrays
How to Get Highest Avg dealing with Arrays
How to use constructors properly.

BIGGEST CHALLENGE
Trying to get my loops to work correctly. I struggled with this and just couldn't get things right until the very end. Lesson would be to make sure the loop is closed at the right area in the code. Attention to detail!
