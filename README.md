### My Food Truck Project Felp

## Biggest Challenge
Trying to get my loops to work correctly. I struggled with this and just couldn't get things right until the very end. Lesson would be to make sure the loop is closed at the right area in the code. Attention to detail!

## Lessons Learned
How to create While loops to execute functions using arrays, how to get the highest avg dealing with arrays, and how to use constructors properly.




## Technologies Used
Eclipse, Atom, Github, Terminal, and Git.

## How Did This Assignment Inspire Me
It showed me how to create an app where the customer can customize objects(Food Trucks) to be able to rate them, list features and more! I feel like I'm am in the beginning steps of designing the new FaceBook, or Yelp.
